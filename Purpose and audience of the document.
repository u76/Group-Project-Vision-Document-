Purpose and audience of the document
This project is mainly purposed to make the work of the credit transfer easy and efficient at the same time. The important task of this project is to make a portal which should be able to make a good communication and collaboration between both students and the credit transfer staffs. Through the portal students should be able to sign in with their student id and password which enables them to upload all the documents required for credit transfer. The students will be able to apply through the portal and the credit department will be able to check all the documents and then finalise the transfer.  This enables both the students and the credit department to avoid the financial or academic penalty and employee underperform as the credit transfer process would be easy and reliable. 
The main targeted audience of this project would be the students and the credit department staff. This project should develop a both mobile friendly and desktop friendly application as the students would be using the both mobile and desktop both. As the audience would not be familiar with all the complicated tools and applications, this application should be simple and easy to work with
